Laptop Automation with a touch of home automation

## Inspiration
Too lazy to get up and use my laptop by hand. Hence needed to come up with an elegant solution that was easily accessible, and I was spending most of my time on WhatsApp anyways so it made sense to use it as a go-to solution.

## Functionality
* **Greetings**
* **Open apps and sites**
* **Close apps**
* **Control volume**
* **Control lights through arduino**
* **Hibernate and Lock Computer**

## Tech Stack

**APIs:** Wit.ai, Twilio

**Server:** Node JS, Express JS, Redis

### Future Plans
* **Access media folders so media can be directly played**
* **Some other laptop commands**
* **Any other thing I can think of**
